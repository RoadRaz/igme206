Currently you are inside a dark and creepy hall past the main door.
Try to search for resources to fight the Demon with.

<SWORD ROOM>
You can see a lot of gore war paintings on the walls.
Behind one of the paintings you find a secret chamber full of Slayer Swords. You picked one sword!
Sword Room connects to -> Hall.|
<SHIELD ROOM>
It's quite a rustic room full of books. Bats panic flee away when you enter.
You see a armored soldier mannequin. You grab the shield on it!
Shield Room connects to -> Hall, Laboratory.|
<LABORATORY>
It's a laboratory room. The demon might be experimenting with something.
You found some energy syrup and drank it to re-energise yourself!

<DEMON ROOM>
It's the Demon Room. The Demon is sitting on his throne and your friend is wounded on the ground besides him.
You charge towards the Demon....|
AHHHHHH! You do not have enough resources to fight against the Demon. The Demon kills you. GAME OVER :(|
Hooray! You defeated the Demon using the Slayer sword and shield.
You and your friend escape the Demon House :)
